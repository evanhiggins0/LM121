In this first assignment for CS4222 Software Development, we were instructed to create methods to manipulate 2D arrays as if they were images, ie:

  public void flip( boolean horizontal )
  public void rotate( boolean clockwise )
  
and creating a toString to display the "images".

I also implemented a "portraitMode" method to confirm how the 2D Array would be initialised.
